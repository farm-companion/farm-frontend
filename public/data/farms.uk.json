Amwell Place Farm, Downfield Road, Hertford Heath, Herts SG13 7RZ. Barry and Jenny Daw have been involved in farming as soon as they could walk, with both their parents working on dairy farms. The love for farming is what brought Barry and Jenny together over 25 years ago and from there their passion has grown. They have been at Amwell Place farm in Hertford Heath since 2002 and have grown the jersey herd to become national award winning cows, gaining red rosettes and championships right across the UK. The cows graze the fields in Hertford Heath over 6 months of the year in the spring and summer when the grass is full of nutrients. In the autumn and winter the cows are fed a tasty mixture of grass, maize (both grown and harvested on our farm), straw, fodder beet and minerals while relaxing on a straw bedded yard which you can see as you collect your milk from the vending machine. Their passion for their jersey cows has rubbed off on their daughter Claire who started making rich, creamy Ice cream from their cows milk making Dawlicious Ice Cream.

There's always something new. Come and visit us today! www.botanybayfarm.co.uk A family run, 76 acre working farm with shop selling local produce 100% pure Botany Bay alpaca, sheared, hand spun, hand knitted, beautiful exclusive gloves, snoods, headbands and beanie hats, now for sale while stocks last available in store. From the reign of Henry II the area was a forested hunting ground. By the 14th century the area became known as Enfield Chase. It is believed that Princess Elizabeth (later Queen Elizabeth I) often hunted on the Chase after she was granted the estate of West Lodge Park by her brother Edward VI in 1547. After an act in 1777 the Enfield Chase estate no longer existed and became deforested. In 2020, 25 acres of the Botany Bay Farm is being reforested as part of an ambitious plan by the London Borough of Enfield in partnership with Thames21. In addition we have submitted further plans for planting over 5,000 new trees within the farm, further restoring the landscape, enhancing the biodiversity and creating more natural habitat for wildlife. Longhorns were a rare breed, but partly because Heston Blumenthal singled Longhorn beef out as his idea of perfection they are now considered a minority breed. Our herd are only 6 miles from Central London and represent not only the highest quality of marbled beef, but also can reduce the carbon footprint of the restaurants buying our beef. We are also home to a growing flock of pedigree rare breed Greyface Dartmoor Sheep. We now have twelve beehives - these honeybees are great pollinators essential for the planet. Did you know? It takes a honeybee 10,000,000 trips to collect enough nectar to make 1 lb Visit Botany Bay Farm Shop to experience authentic local produce and traditional farming values.",

    "description": "Keepers Cottage Organics is a family-run farm shop located in Derbyshire. It is with great sadness that from 1st March 2023 we are no longer organic certified. We have decided to do this because of the costs of certification and the closure of our organic poultry abbatoir. We aren’t changing the way we farm, we are just no longer maintaining our organic certification and we welcome any questions about that. We will be updating our name, branding and website address in due course to reflect this change. Keepers Cottage Organics started in 200?? On a 7 acre smallholding in Staffordshire and from Katie’s desire to live off the land, to grow veg and rear animals for meat so that she knew exactly how everything on her plate had been reared or grown and taking care of the land to ensure a sustainable production without damage to the wider environment. An opportunity arose to co farm on an organic farm near Stoke On Trent. Katie moved her beloved rare breed pigs to the new farm and Keepers Cottage Organics was born. The emphasis shifted to producing the highest quality pork and poultry from.animals with exceptional welfare standards. In May 2020 Katie bought her own land in Derbyshire and put it into organic conversion. We have a mixture of woodland, upland grazing and meadow fields. The emphasis now changed to balancing meat production with being the custodians of a beautiful parcel of land on Bradwell Edge. This is not easy farming, and it is driven by being grateful for what the land can provide for us, rather than a need to produce a target from it. We have woodland for the pigs, upland grazing for the sheep and goats, and meadow fields for the poultry. We also have a mass of biodiversity in terms of flora and fauna to take care of. Visit Keepers Cottage Organics to experience authentic local produce and traditional farming values.",

    "description": "Lowe's Farm Shop is a family-run farm shop located in Cheshire East. Variety of Locally Sourced Condiments& Household Products “Combining over 60 years of hard work and shared family knowledge” Lowe’s Farm shop offers a great selection of fresh produce, groceries, nursery plants and much more for clients throughout Cheshire. The Lowe Family have resided at Shanty Farm, Byley for over 60 years and Mrs Lowe started Lowes Farm shop with a small home-grown vegetable stall in the yard area. Lowe’s Farm Shop progressed to out-buildings in the early 20th century and a wide variety of locally sourced produce was added to the range. In 2011 Lowe’s Farm Shop expanded further into a purpose-built building and this was extended in 2015 to what you see today. In 2018 Lowes Farm Shop was completely re-branded and refurbished with even more fantastic new products added to the range. In 2019 we installed two log cabins in the grounds of the shop, Ingledew Therapy and Tasche Keys Beauty opened their businesses in them shortly after. In 2020 Ginger & Pickles Tea room opened including an outside seating area and courtyard. We also welcomed a third log cabin in which Cheshire Wardrobe Boutique opened. Frame Cheshire also joined us in a building opposite the Farm Shop. “Great place with plenty of choice. The shop ladies were helpful and went out of there way to help. Thank you.” “Love that they sell all sorts, steak & mushroom pies are to die for, Cheshire potatoes taste fabulous.” Visit Lowe's Farm Shop to experience authentic local produce and traditional farming values.",

Sidney Parker bought the farm in 1919 and later established S. J. Parker and Son which is still trading today under the careful hands of his grandson Simon Parker and his wife Elaine. As a traditional Herefordshire farm we grow hops (our passion), cider fruit and Bramleys along with more unusual cobnuts and soft fruit. We also have free-range laying hens and run pedigree Ryeland, Coloured Ryeland and Dutch Spotted Sheep along with a commercial flock. Simon is passionate about hops and in addition to being a director of Hawkbrand hops, has an active part in the British Hop Association with the aim of promoting the use of British hops and developing new and exciting aromas. In 2017 we installed a vending machine to offer farm fresh produce 24/7. We are thrilled with the success of this venture and hope to expand in the near future. Instone CourtMunderfieldNr.

Poplars Farm is a family run farm and shop, farming 500 acres of land in the Warwickshire countryside, 2.5 miles from Nuneaton town centre. As commercial crops we grow wheat, oilseed, rape and potatoes which we sell through our farm shop, and other local shops. The farm is also entered into the entry level steward ship scheme helping to provide habitats for wildlife through over-wintered crop residues, alternative year hedge cutting and 10 metre grass margins around all of our watercourses. We look forward to seeing you around at Poplars Farm! We visited poplars farm shop today as we were visiting family in the area and I realised I needed a pumpkin for the kids this weekend. I found this place totally by surprise and what a wonderful surprise it was! There was so much for the kids to enjoy from the music and atmosphere, following the pumpkin track to incy wincy, hiding in the maize maze to squelching in the mud. The staff here were so friendly and chatty especially with the little ones! All in all we had a wonderful hour here, got our pumpkin & will 100% be returning next time we are over this way!

    "description": "Bradbury's farm shop & Butchery is a family-run farm shop located in Staffordshire. Local Farm Shop and Butchery located at Curborough Countryside Centre in Lichfield, Staffordshire offering quality local produce. At Bradbury's Farm Shop & Butchery we are passionate about producing from our own family farm in Tamworth and sourcing produce as locally as possible. A family run Farm Shop and Butchery in Lichfield, Staffordshire To supply the local community with fresh and local produce and spread the knowledge of farming. Farming is in my blood. I grew up on a Staﬀordshire County Council farm. It is what I’ve known all my life, and when my parents - Jean & Raymond Bradbury - retired back in 2000 it was at this point I knew I needed to keep our family farming tradition alive. We are not a commercial farm, far from it, all our livestock are grown free range and at their own rate, naturally and slowly the way we believe they should be. Being a third-generation farming family we strongly believe in bringing our produce direct from the farm to our customers - from ‘ﬁeld to fork’. And this is when our farm shop dream started to happen.

We have a commitment to providing our produce as fresh as possible and, as we grow our own produce, it is often the case that fruit and vegetables are less than an hour old before they are sold in our farm shop. March 2007 saw the opening of our Butchery and Deli, giving us an outlet for our own free-range pork and Hereford beef, as well as lamb from neighbouring farmers. We opened our restaurant in 1990 enabling us to offer our own produce cooked in our country kitchen restaurant.

Farming with passion, pride, we live through our livestock! Grazing the best grass growing country on earth, passion drives us. I never write reviews but for this I’ll make an exception. This is the best steak I’ve had and very reasonably priced!! Will definitely be back again! We discovered Tori and Ben's last year and always come for our beef when we have a roast as a treat. We'd much rather shop local instead of the supermarket and love visiting and seeing what's available. We travel from Swad. Visited today at 3.30pm and with it being Sunday we didn't expect there to much left, but the lady at the till was able to get us a lovely portion of silverside and some broccoli for us to enjoy as a Sunday Roast.Always a decent price for meat and a great service. Just the best food you can buy. The meat is just fab... and the bread... and the curry. I could go on. Great service, great food and totally delicious.

    "description": "Tomlinson's Farm Shop is a family-run farm shop located in Leicestershire. The Tomlinson family has had its roots in farming for many generations. Garth's mother's family, the Scriveners, farmed originally in Lincolnshire and then moved to Top House Farm in Shenton. Garth's grandfather, Edward Scrivener then married into the Vernon family who had farmed at Hall Farm in Dadlington for generations. Edward and Anne continued to farm at Hall Farm and had 3 children, Gerald, Vernon and Margaret. Margaret is Garth's mother and she married a local boy George Tomlinson, whose relations, the Busbys, also farmed in Dadlington. Garth's mother produced her first turkeys in 1943. she took her first turkey to be mated at Sutton Cheney, on the bus. The father of a friend of ours took his pig to be mated in the sidecar of his motorbike! Those were the days! Garth took over the business from his parents in 1986. Garth and I got together in 1997. At that time Garth was producing turkeys, geese, ducks and cockerels at Christmas and contract hedge cutting all year round, I was working as a customer service team manager for a large chemical company. The farm was famous in the area for the Ostrich’s that Garth had in the front field and there was often someone hanging over the fence looking at them! A Stoke Golding tapestry was made to commemorate the millennium and the Ostriches are recorded for posterity on this tapestry. We began producing free range chickens all year round. This was at the time when farmers markets were starting so we sold our chickens at all the local markets ones and at the farm gate. We also sold to other farm shops and butchers, many of whom we still supply today. In 2005 we opened our Farm Shop, we are planning our 10th anniversairy celebration for 2015!
